A-0907S;A-0907M;A-0907L;A-0907XL,Bry-Dan Tree Climbing Harness,"Invented by Ed Hobbs in 1969, this belt was so advanced 40 years ago that it is still one of the most comfortable tree climbing harnesses ever made. In 2009, we teamed up with Weaver Leather to modernize the Bry-Dan without comprising its unique and original character. The 40th Anniversary Edition Bry-Dan has an 8-inch wide backpad with improved foam padding for comfort and support. The legstraps are now adjustable which was probably the most requested improvement. The backpad has 6 steel tool rings and two loops of webbing for carrying plenty of gear. The suspenders are integral to the design and are famous for their strength and comfort. Our most enthusiastic customers are climbers who know the pain of carrying a heavy chainsaw on a conventional saddle. The waistbelt threads through loops on the legstraps helping to distribute the load between the legs and the waist belt.

Klettersteig biners have a wide gate opening which makes them easy to clip onto the safety cables and attachment points. The large internal volume makes this type of biner well suited to rigging scenarios. It is of course very tough and the zinc plating gives extra corrosion protection.
E-C842,Screwgate-----E-C843,Quicklock-----E-C847,Locksafe---Strength Gate Closed 45kN
<strong>12mm Offset D</strong>
This is a super tough biner capable of dealing with the harshest environments. The offset D shape maximises the strength of the biner by placing the load close and parallel to the spine. It’s so strong that it passes the industry standard ANSI Z359.1. We've also zinc plated the steel to give it more wear resistance.
E-C812,Screwgate-----E-C813,Quicklock-----E-C817,Locksafe---Strength Gate Closed 45kN
<strong>Captive Eye</strong>
The benefit of a captive eye biner is that it provides a predictable direction of load. This design is ideal for use as the end connector on a lanyard, especially when durability and strength are more important than weight. We have zinc plated it to give extra corrosion protection.
E-C962,Screwgate-----E-C963,Quicklock-----E-C967,Locksafe---Strength Gate Closed 45kN
<strong>12mm Boa</strong>
If durability and strength are more important to you than saving weight, then this is the perfect belaying/rigging biner. The Steel Boa may be 266g but it is also incredibly strong (a whopping 40kN Gate closed strength!), plus it has a zinc coating to protect against corrosion. The generous gate opening and large internal volume means it can accommodate multiple knots and is easy to handle in gloves. There is one final advantage too: it is made from smooth 12mm bar which allows easy rotation in attachment eyes.

F-1800,Rigging Plate,"An essential component in an advanced Speed Line operation, the Rigging Plate creates a platform to hang the traveling block, haul back line and rigging slings from efficiently and in the proper alignment. A key feature to the Rigging Plate is it's weight of at least 8 pounds. What many people unfamiliar with Speed Line rigging don't understand is that weight in the traveling block is essential to performance. The weight helps to prevent the Load Line and Haul Back line from getting crossed and jammed. The weight also ensures that the haul back line will haul back. If there's no weight in the traveling block, it won't come down unless it's under load and that isn't always possible or desirable. The holes along the bottom permit the attachment of several rigging slings. Handy when working in closely branched pine trees. Attach the Haul Back line to the 5/8-inch shackle provided. The F-RP104 pulley is ideal for Speed Lines up to 5/8-inch, and it works even better with 9/16-inch. Remember at all times, a major advantage of technical rigging is that you can maintain control in an efficient manner. The time you save should be invested in taking smaller pieces.",Rigging and Tree Removal Equipment|Rigging Plate,https://images.blairsae.com/products/rigging-and-tree-removal-equipment/rigging-plate_1.jpg|https://images.blairsae.com/products/rigging-and-tree-removal-equipment/rigging-plate_2.jpg|https://images.blairsae.com/products/rigging-and-tree-removal-equipment/rigging-plate_3.jpg|https://images.blairsae.com/products/rigging-and-tree-removal-equipment/rigging-plate_4.jpg|https://images.blairsae.com/products/rigging-and-tree-removal-equipment/rigging-plate_5.jpg

F-1712;F-1734;F-1738;F-1755;F-1758,Screw Pin Anchor Shackle,"AKA clevis. Shackles make a strong, secure and inexpensive connecting link between slings and pulleys and many other fittings. No rope should ever be ""run"" through a shackle ""under load"" because the tight bend ration can reduce rope strength by as much as 50%. Increased friction can also lead to heat fusion failure which is a technical way of saying the rope can get so hot it could melt through and fail with potentially catastrophic results. That said, shackles and screw links are quite often a much better alternative to carabiners in certain rigging applications where strength is more important than repetitive opening and closing. If you can set it and forget it for extended periods of time, a shackle or screw link might be the most best choice. <table>
