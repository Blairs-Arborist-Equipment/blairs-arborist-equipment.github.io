Lanyards from right to left. A. 1-inch manila wire-cored flipline with a “Yankee Snap”, note the large radius the eye has to protect the rope from chaffing. B. A predecessor of the cammed adjusters currently available. It worked well, but the lanyard had to be spliced after being threaded through the device and couldn’t be changed out without undoing the splice. Once the Microjuster and Macrojuster became available, all arborist interest in this product faded. C. 1-inch nylon webbing adjustable lanyard. Still available with an improved locking snap as part number C-1813. D. Classic tree climber’s adjustable rope lanyard. Still available with improved snaps as part number C-1812. Handsaw is one of Millard Blair’s “bullsaws” for cutting large limbs and bucking felled trees into length. These were one-man saws, Millard worked along a lot during World War Two.
