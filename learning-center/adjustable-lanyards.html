Detail image of C-1350 Microjuster. This product is an excellent example of what we mean when we say “ARBORIST GRADE”. The inspiration for a cammed lanyard adjuster came late in the 20th Century when Don Blair handled one of Rock Thompson’s Rock Exotica Microcenders. Blair drop tested the microcender and determined that the body wasn’t strong enough to meet a 5,000 pound minimum tensile strength rating. Blair also felt that a bolt was preferable to a quick-release pin. Blair discussed his design changes with Mr. Thompson, placed an order and history was made. Although the product is no longer an exclusive of Sierra Moreno, it originated as a joint collaboration between Rock Thompson and Don Blair and not Petzl. No brag, just fact. The saddle the Microjuster is attached to is an A-3025 Original Utility saddle. First introduced in 1980 by Sierra Moreno, this saddle is really the Genesis of many of the high-tech separate leg strap, floating tie-in harnesses available today. It was also the beginning to the development of our modular saddles like the Blair and Blair IBS which completely revolutionized tree saddles over 30 years ago. So what was the inspiration for the Utility saddle? That would be a handmade, manila rope strung saddle popular on the West Coast in the 1950’s through the 1970’s when Don Blair turned manila rope into nylon webbing and named it after Utility Tree Service in Eureka, California, an established line clearing company who became Sierra Moreno’s best customer for that saddle. Still popular today with many climbers, next to the Bry-Dan, it remains one of Don Blair’s personal favorites.
