Even though most climbers have embraced prusiks, and mechanical lanyard adjusters like the C1400 Macrojuster, every climber using a flipline should know how to deploy it without additional support. If you were tying this bend “rope-to-rope”, it would be called a sheetbend. When applied to a fitting, it properly becomes known as a Becket Bend. Once tied as shown, it is played out to lengthen and taken in to shorten. Most right-handed climbers tie-off the flipline on the left side so the can throw with their left and catch with their strong right hand. Be sure to dress the bend as illustrated and test before trusting all of your weight. Practice on the ground until you can do it blindfolded.
