<p>
The boy’s were whipping it up one night in the Euc Man’s favorite saloon,
<br/>Smoking, drinking and playing dice, they’d fight by the light of the moon.
<br/>The juke box blared out raucous noise, it was Fifties rock and roll,
<br/>when the door burst wide, who stepped inside, but the Euc Man John McRoe.
</p>
<p>
The music stopped, the dice lay froze, the men, they eyed the door,
<br/>His Wesco’s drummed a macho beat as he strode across the floor,
<br/>Swaggering up to the bar came he, his money did he lay,
<br/>“Rebel Yell, without a glass,” is all they heard him say.
</p>
<p>
From out of the shadows a voice boomed out, it was calm and clear and cool,
<br/>“Who is that brute at the end of the bar, drinking whiskey like a fool?
<br/>I can tell by the trucks in the parking lot, there’s Euc men in this bar,
<br/>By the beat-up Fords and the four-wheel drives and that brush trailer towed by a car.”
</p>
<p>
“Belly up to the bar boys, for I’m bound to tell my tale.”
<br/>The stranger slapped a bill on the bar. “This C-Note buys the ale.”
<br/>The Euc Men rushed like pigs to a trough, to get their share of brew,
<br/>McRoe eyed the stranger warily, “an Oak Man through and through.”
</p>
<p>
“What brings you around to our part of town? For why you buy me drink?”
<br/>The Oak Man said, “You guys are clowns, and I think your tree work stinks!
<br/>Now just hold off for a moment or two, there’s always time to fight,
<br/>I come in peace, I promise you, but I want the trees pruned right!”
</p>
<p>
The Oak Man’s words were like a bomb that blew the room away.
<br/>The Euc Men stood with dropping jaw, they knew not what to say.
<br/>The bar keep grabbed his baseball bat, gun and hard hat too,
<br/>He knew the score, he knew these guys, he knew what Euc Men do.
</p>
<p>
The Euc Men smashed some chairs for clubs and drew their wicked knives,
<br/>The patrons knocked the front door down in fleeing for their lives.
<br/>The Oak Man stood in calm repose, taking in the scene.
<br/>McRoe stood glaring over him…he’d never looked so mean.
</p>
<p>
“Before we fight,” The Oak Man said, “Bar Keep, a Perrier,
<br/>I’ve come to talk about tree work and this is what I’ll say;
<br/>The days of pickup trucks and spikes are coming to an end,
<br/>The Flush Cut’s dead, I promise you…on that you can depend.
</p>
<p>
Become a pro and join with me and learn what’s going on,
<br/>Do it right or not at all, should be your working song.”
<br/>McRoe was sold, deep down he knew the Oak Man’s words were right.
<br/>“Drop the clubs and stash the knives, tonight there’ll be no fight.
</p>
<p>
We’ll come with you and learn the ways of Shigo and the rest.
<br/>And when we’re through the world will know that Euc Men are the best!
<br/>The beat-up Fords and the four-wheel drives and that brush trailer towed
<br/>by a car, will stay the same, we will not change and we’ll always fight in bars.
<br/>And by the way, I have no choice, I’m sure you understand,
<br/>McRoe, the Euc Man decked our boy with a smash from his huge right hand.
<br/>Flying off into the night the Oak Man he did go,
<br/>And as I leave you with this song, There’s one thing you should know.
</p>
<p>
Oak is Oak and Euc is Euc and if the twain should meet;
<br/>although the work is better now, a Euc Man’s hard to beat.
<br/>The Oak Man tries to reason sense…The Euc Man’s more direct.
<br/>Make a cut too close these days, it’s a flush cut you’ll regret.
