Our climber is resting one of his Wesco boots on a vintage McCulloch chainsaw from the 1960’s. He is wearing B-5213 Original Euc Pads strapped to B-9142 Buckingham “Redwood” Climbers with 3-1/2-inch non-replaceable gaffs. The saddle is a “Marling” saddle. The Marling was Sierra Moreno’s first saddle released in 1976 as an updated version of the classic Davey belt. Dick Marling a 20 year Davey man had approved of the changes so Blair honored Dick by naming the belt after him. A wire-cored flipline is tied-off to the left waist Dee ring.
