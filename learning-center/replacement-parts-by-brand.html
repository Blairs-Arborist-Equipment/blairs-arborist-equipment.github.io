Vintage climbers surrounding replacement parts currently available: split rings, straps, straps with split rings, and sliding tops. Antique climbers clockwise from 11:00: Hand forged climbers from Australia. Shank pad sewn by a saddle maker actually looks like a good idea. The gaffs don’t. Early 20th Century factory-made lineman’s pole climbers. Note that the shank is non-adjustable. The wooden spurs are one of the most unusual and unique artifacts in our collection. The shank and stirrup is made from hickory. The iron work is all blacksmith forged. Having never seen such a tool in my life, I suspect that it could very well date back to the mid-19th Century for use in building the telegraph lines that criss-crossed the nation before the Civil War. They either pre-date Klein, Buckingham, Bashlin and Brooks entry into manufacturing climbers or they were made out of necessity by someone who just had to have a set of climbers and couldn’t afford store bought. Whatever the case, the artifact speaks for itself as yet another remarkable example of Euc Man ingenuity.
